# VLAN Segmentation Deployment Lab  
Guest / IoT / Trusted Network Isolation using ASUSWRT-Merlin

---

## Problem Statement / Motivation

The home network was originally deployed as a flat Layer 2 network where all devices—trusted computers, IoT devices, and guest devices—shared the same broadcast domain and IP subnet.  

This created several risks:

- IoT devices could potentially access trusted systems
- Guest devices were not isolated from internal resources
- No policy-based control over east-west (lateral) traffic
- Increased blast radius in the event of a compromised device

The objective of this lab was to redesign the network using **VLAN-based segmentation** and **inter-VLAN firewall policies** to enforce least-privilege access and simulate small-business / enterprise security zoning principles in a home environment.

---

## Overview

This project documents the implementation of true VLAN-based network segmentation on an ASUS RT-AX58U router using ASUSWRT-Merlin firmware.

The goal was to separate home devices into three security zones:

- **Trusted Devices** (Primary computers, phones, NAS, lab systems)
- **IoT Devices** (Smart TVs, cameras, smart plugs, etc.)
- **Guest Devices** (Visitors)

Each SSID is mapped to a dedicated VLAN and subnet, with inter-VLAN firewall rules enforcing least-privilege access.

This lab simulates small-business / enterprise segmentation principles using consumer hardware enhanced with advanced firmware.

## Environment

- **Router:** ASUS RT-AX58U  
- **Firmware:** ASUSWRT-Merlin  
- **Topology:** Single router, multiple SSIDs mapped to VLANs  
- **Clients:** Windows, mobile devices, and IoT devices  
- **Network Type:** SOHO / Home Lab  
- **WAN:** ISP-provided Internet connection

## Network Architecture

| Network  | VLAN ID | Subnet           | Purpose                  |
|----------|----------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Trusted  | VLAN 10  | 192.168.10.0/24  | Full LAN access          |
| IoT      | VLAN 20  | 192.168.20.0/24  | Internet + limited access|
| Guest    | VLAN 30  | 192.168.30.0/24  | Internet only            |

Each VLAN is bound to its own bridge interface and DHCP scope.

## Before vs After Security Model

### Before (Flat Network)

- All devices in the same subnet
- No traffic segmentation
- No policy-based access control
- High risk of lateral movement
- Guests and IoT had access to internal devices

### After (Segmented Network)

- 3 isolated VLANs (Trusted, IoT, Guest)
- Explicit inter-VLAN firewall rules
- Least-privilege access enforced
- Reduced attack surface
- Contained blast radius if a device is compromised

---

## Security Model

- **Guest →** No access to private networks  
- **IoT →** Cannot initiate connections to Trusted  
- **Trusted →** Can access IoT (optional, for control apps)  
- **All VLANs →** Internet access allowed

## Step 1 – Flash ASUSWRT-Merlin

1. Download firmware for RT-AX58U from ASUSWRT-Merlin.
2. Log into the router at:  
   `http://192.168.1.1`
3. Navigate to:  
   `Administration → Firmware Upgrade`
4. Upload the `.trx` firmware file.
5. After reboot, perform a factory reset.
6. Reconfigure WAN and base Wi-Fi before continuing.

---

## Step 2 – Enable JFFS Custom Scripts

Navigate to:  
`Administration → System`

Enable:

- JFFS custom scripts and configs = Yes  
- Format JFFS partition at next boot (first time only)

Reboot the router.

---

## Step 3 – VLAN Design & Subnet Planning

Defined VLAN segmentation:

- `br0.10` → 192.168.10.1 (Trusted)  
- `br0.20` → 192.168.20.1 (IoT)  
- `br0.30` → 192.168.30.1 (Guest)  

Each VLAN configured with:

- Dedicated IP interface  
- Independent DHCP scope  
- Firewall policy enforcement  

---

## Step 4 – Map SSIDs to VLANs

Created three wireless networks:

- `Home_Trusted` → VLAN 10  
- `Home_IoT` → VLAN 20  
- `Home_Guest` → VLAN 30  

### Validation

1. Connect a test device.
2. Run: ipconfig
3. Confirm IP address matches expected subnet.

## Step 5 – Inter-VLAN Firewall Policy

Implemented firewall rules via:

/jffs/scripts/firewall-start

### Policy Logic

**Guest VLAN**
- Block access to RFC1918 private ranges
- Allow Internet only

**IoT VLAN**
- Block IoT → Trusted subnet
- Allow Internet
- Allow Established/Related traffic

**Trusted VLAN**
- Allow full access (or selectively allow IoT only)

### Example Logic Representation

Block IoT initiating to Trusted:

192.168.20.0/24 → 192.168.10.0/24 = DROP

Block Guest to internal networks:

192.168.30.0/24 → 192.168.0.0/16 = DROP

Allow Trusted to IoT:

192.168.10.0/24 → 192.168.20.0/24 = ACCEPT

## 🔄 Step 6 – mDNS / Service Discovery Handling

To maintain device discovery (AirPlay, Chromecast, IoT control):

- Enabled mDNS reflection (if supported)
- Allowed UDP 5353 between Trusted ↔ IoT
- Restricted direction where possible

Result:

- Smart devices discoverable
- IoT still isolated from Trusted devices

---

## Validation Testing

Each SSID receives correct VLAN subnet  
Guest devices cannot access LAN resources  
IoT cannot initiate connections to Trusted  
Trusted devices can control IoT devices  
Internet functional across all VLANs
