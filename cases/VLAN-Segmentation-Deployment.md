# VLAN Segmentation Deployment Lab  
Guest / IoT / Trusted Network Isolation using ASUSWRT-Merlin

---

## Problem Statement / Motivation

The home network was originally deployed as a flat Layer 2 network where all devices—trusted computers, IoT devices, and guest devices—shared the same broadcast domain and IP subnet.  

This created several risks:

- IoT devices could potentially access trusted systems
- Guest devices were not isolated from internal resources
- No policy-based control over east-west (lateral) traffic
- Increased blast radius in the event of a compromised device

The objective of this lab was to redesign the network using **VLAN-based segmentation** and **inter-VLAN firewall policies** to enforce least-privilege access and simulate small-business / enterprise security zoning principles in a home environment.

## Overview

This project documents the implementation of true VLAN-based network segmentation on an ASUS RT-AX58U router using ASUSWRT-Merlin firmware.

The goal was to separate home devices into three security zones:

- **Trusted Devices** (Primary computers, phones, NAS, lab systems)
- **IoT Devices** (Smart TVs, cameras, smart plugs, etc.)
- **Guest Devices** (Visitors)

Each SSID is mapped to a dedicated VLAN and subnet, with inter-VLAN firewall rules enforcing least-privilege access.

This lab simulates small-business / enterprise segmentation principles using consumer hardware enhanced with advanced firmware.

## Environment

- **Router:** ASUS RT-AX58U  
- **Firmware:** ASUSWRT-Merlin  
- **Topology:** Single router, multiple SSIDs mapped to VLANs  
- **Clients:** Windows, mobile devices, and IoT devices  
- **Network Type:** SOHO / Home Lab  
- **WAN:** ISP-provided Internet connection

## 🏗 Network Architecture

| Network  | VLAN ID | Subnet           | Purpose                  |
|----------|----------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Trusted  | VLAN 10  | 192.168.10.0/24  | Full LAN access          |
| IoT      | VLAN 20  | 192.168.20.0/24  | Internet + limited access|
| Guest    | VLAN 30  | 192.168.30.0/24  | Internet only            |

Each VLAN is bound to its own bridge interface and DHCP scope.

## Before vs After Security Model

### Before (Flat Network)

- All devices in the same subnet
- No traffic segmentation
- No policy-based access control
- High risk of lateral movement
- Guests and IoT had access to internal devices

### After (Segmented Network)

- 3 isolated VLANs (Trusted, IoT, Guest)
- Explicit inter-VLAN firewall rules
- Least-privilege access enforced
- Reduced attack surface
- Contained blast radius if a device is compromised

---

## Security Model

- **Guest →** No access to private networks  
- **IoT →** Cannot initiate connections to Trusted  
- **Trusted →** Can access IoT (optional, for control apps)  
- **All VLANs →** Internet access allowed

## 🔧 Step 1 – Flash ASUSWRT-Merlin

1. Download firmware for RT-AX58U from ASUSWRT-Merlin.
2. Log into the router at:  
   `http://192.168.1.1`
3. Navigate to:  
   `Administration → Firmware Upgrade`
4. Upload the `.trx` firmware file.
5. After reboot, perform a factory reset.
6. Reconfigure WAN and base Wi-Fi before continuing.

## Step 2 – Enable JFFS Custom Scripts

Navigate to:  
`Administration → System`

Enable:

- JFFS custom scripts and configs = Yes  
- Format JFFS partition at next boot (first time only)

Reboot the router.

## Step 3 – VLAN Design & Subnet Planning

Defined VLAN segmentation:

- `br0.10` → 192.168.10.1 (Trusted)  
- `br0.20` → 192.168.20.1 (IoT)  
- `br0.30` → 192.168.30.1 (Guest)  

Each VLAN configured with:

- Dedicated IP interface  
- Independent DHCP scope  
- Firewall policy enforcement  

---

## Step 4 – Map SSIDs to VLANs

Created three wireless networks:

- `Home_Trusted` → VLAN 10  
- `Home_IoT` → VLAN 20  
- `Home_Guest` → VLAN 30  

### Validation

1. Connect a test device.
2. Run:
